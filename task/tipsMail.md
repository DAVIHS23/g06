Dear All

I hope you are doing well

I would like to clarify some points which can be of interest
to all of you.

- Don't over-design your dashboards. Always remember less is
more
- Think about the users of your dashboard and design for
them
- Think about the questions your dashboard will answer and
answer one question at a time
- Use relative values in comparisons
- Read the documents on Ilias under the section 'Interaction
Concepts'. You will find more useful guidelines to follow.

One last thing, please pay attention to the guidelines on
the Projekt_DAVI_D3.pdf document. This is important for the
evaluation.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have further
questions

Regards
Heba
